# Computer Science 2 Homework 2
Welcome back friends.
Now we begin using those git skills we started.

## Chapter:
This assignment is out of Chapter 4, 5, and 6.

## Grading:
There are 4 problems.
You will do pair programming for this assignment.
You will be given 25 points per problem.
You will get 10 points for a copy of your code.
You will get 10 points for a copy of your console output that demonstrates your code works.
You will get 5 points for a discussion of your code explaining what it does and what you learned.

## Problems to work:

1. Problem 4.4 (Geometry: area of a hexagon) The area of a hexagon can be computed using the
following formula (s is the length of a side):
Area = (6 * s^2)/ (4 * tan(pi/6)
Write a program that prompts the user to enter the side of a hexagon and displays
its area.

Here is a sample run:
Enter the side: 5.5
The area of the hexagon is 78.59

2. problem 4.12 (Hex to binary) Write a program that prompts the user to enter a hex digit and
displays its corresponding binary number. Here is a sample run:
Enter a hex digit: B
The binary value is 1011
Enter a hex digit: G
G is an invalid input

3. (Math: combinations) Write a program that displays all possible combinations
for picking two numbers from integers 1 to 7. Also display the total number of
all combinations.

1 2
1 3
...
...
The total number of all combinations is 21


4. Problem 6.32 (Game: chance of winning at craps) Revise Exercise 6.30 to run it 10,000 times
and display the number of winning games.

## How to turn it in:
Please use the following format for your reports.
Please use the repository:
https://github.com/swosu/ComputerScience2CourseMaterials.git
Inside that repository, please put your files in the folder:
```sh
CS1CourseMaterials/CS1HW2
```
Please name your report:
"First Name""Last Name" CS2HW2.md

Please write your report on your branch and merge your branch to the dev branch when you are finished.

I will merge the dev branch into the master branch before grading the assignment.

## Report Structure:
Please structure your report as follows:

brief introduction to the problem set and what you will demonstrate

## Problem 1 Your Code:

```java
    Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
		//area of a hexagon, Area = (6 * s^2)/ (4 * tan(pi/6))\
		// Write a program that prompts the user to enter the side of a hexagon and displays
		//TODO Try/Catch
		System.out.print("Enter the side: ");
		double side = input.nextDouble();
		double area = (6 * Math.pow(side, 2))/ (4 * Math.tan((Math.PI/6)));
		System.out.println("The area of the hexagon is " + area);
```

## Problem 1 Partner Code:

```java
```

## Problem 1 Output:

```sh
Enter the side: 5.5
The area of the hexagon is 78.59180539343781
```

## Problem 2 Your Code:

```java
    //TODO prompt user to enter hex, display binary number
		//Just copied fromhttp://soultionmanual.blogspot.com/2016/07/chapter-4-exercise-12-introduction-to.html
		Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
		  System.out.print("Enter a hex digit: ");
		  String hexString = input.nextLine();

		  // Check if the hex string has exactly one character
		  if (hexString.length() != 1) {
		   System.out.println("You must enter exactly one character");
		   System.exit(1);
		  }

		  // Display decimal value for the hex digit
		  char ch = Character.toUpperCase(hexString.charAt(0));
		  int value = 0;
		  if (ch <= 'F' && ch >= 'A') {
		   value = ch - 'A' + 10;
		  } else if (Character.isDigit(ch)) {
		   value = ch - '0';
		  } else {
		   System.out.println(ch + " is an invalid input");
		   System.exit(0);
		  }

		  System.out.println("The decimal value for hex digit " + ch + " is "
		    + Integer.toBinaryString(value));
```

## Problem 2 Partner Code:

```java
```

## Problem 2 Output:

```sh
Enter a hex digit: f
The decimal value for hex digit F is 1111
```

## Problem 3 Your Code:

```java
//Write a program that displays all possible combinations for picking two numbers from integers 1 to 7.
		int counter = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < 8; i++)
        {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < 8; j++)
            {
                System.out.println(i + " " + j);
                counter++;
            }

		 public static int roll() {
		  int dice1 = intRandom(1, 6);
		  int dice2 = intRandom(1, 6);
		  int sum = dice1 + dice2;

		  System.out.println("You roll " + dice1 + " + " + dice2 + " = " + sum);

		  return sum;

		 public static int craps() {

		  int first = 0;
		  int status = 0; // 0 = neither lose or win, 1 = win , -1 = lose

		  // First roll

		  first = roll();
