8. (5 points) This assignment is uploaded to each person's own branch and one member from each team merges their personal branch up to the dev branch.



For any credit at all, you must submit a markdown report through the github repository on your own branch and then merge your branch into the dev branch. Both members have to have their own branch with the report. Only 1 member has to merge the report into the dev branch. I will merge the dev branch into the master branch on the due date for full credit.:
