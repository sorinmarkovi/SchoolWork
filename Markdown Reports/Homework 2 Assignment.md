# Computer Science 2 Homework 2
Welcome back friends.
Now we begin using those git skills we started.

## Chapter:
This assignment is out of Chapter 4, 5, and 6.

## Grading:
There are 4 problems.
You will do pair programming for this assignment.
You will be given 25 points per problem.
You will get 10 points for a copy of your code.
You will get 10 points for a copy of your console output that demonstrates your code works.
You will get 5 points for a discussion of your code explaining what it does and what you learned.

## Problems to work:

1. Problem 4.4 (Geometry: area of a hexagon) The area of a hexagon can be computed using the
following formula (s is the length of a side):
Area = (6 * s^2)/ (4 * tan(pi/6)
Write a program that prompts the user to enter the side of a hexagon and displays
its area.

Here is a sample run:
Enter the side: 5.5
The area of the hexagon is 78.59

2. problem 4.12 (Hex to binary) Write a program that prompts the user to enter a hex digit and
displays its corresponding binary number. Here is a sample run:
Enter a hex digit: B
The binary value is 1011
Enter a hex digit: G
G is an invalid input

3. (Math: combinations) Write a program that displays all possible combinations
for picking two numbers from integers 1 to 7. Also display the total number of
all combinations.

1 2
1 3
...
...
The total number of all combinations is 21


4. Problem 6.32 (Game: chance of winning at craps) Revise Exercise 6.30 to run it 10,000 times
and display the number of winning games.

## How to turn it in:
Please use the following format for your reports.
Please use the repository:
https://github.com/swosu/ComputerScience2CourseMaterials.git
Inside that repository, please put your files in the folder:
```sh
CS1CourseMaterials/CS1HW2
```
Please name your report:
"First Name""Last Name" CS2HW2.md

Please write your report on your branch and merge your branch to the dev branch when you are finished.

I will merge the dev branch into the master branch before grading the assignment.
